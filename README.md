# ScreenMirrorFix
For mirroring to Samsung TV somehow zooms in. To run Python is required

This for those of who experienced zoom issue while mirroring Windows 10 screen to Samsung TV it is basically it automates resolution change  and then change back to original recommended resolution however due to Windows 10 and because simply Microsoft don't want you to do it automatically you will have to manually press down arrow when resolution change menu is popped up and second time also to change the original recommended and don't hit down arrow while it's opening System settings.

When pressing down arrow you will have 3 seconds otherwise things will go to a different direction which I'm afraid I do not know most likely in that case move your mouse to one of four corners of your screen
